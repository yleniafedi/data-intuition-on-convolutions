# Intuition on Convolutions

Now is a great time to build a more solid understanding of Computer Vision. 

How does a Convolutional Neural Network analyze images?

In this `Intuition on Convolutions` challenge, you will:
- apply kernels to images
- discover how an image is perceived by a ConvNet through its convolutional layers (the `layers.Conv2D`).
